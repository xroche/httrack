Engine limits:

These are the principals limits of HTTrack for that moment. Note that we did not heard about any other utility
that would have solved them.

- Several scripts generating complex filenames may not find them (ex: img.src='image'+a+Mobj.dst+'.gif')
- Some java classes may not find some files on them (class included)
- Cgi-bin links may not work properly in some cases (parameters needed). To avoid them: use filters like -*cgi-bin*


Advanced options:

These options may not be necessary for a normal usage. But they can solve several problems.

- If you need more than 100,000 links: -#L1000000 (1,000,000 links)
- If you need more than 500 filters: -#F1000 (1,000 filters)
- If you need transfer rate statictics every minutes: -#Z
- If you need transfer operations statistics every minutes: -#T
- If you want log files to be refreshed after every line: -#f


Thank you!


Have fun with HTTrack Website Copier!
